# Amazon Mturk API Walkthrough

## Introduction 
<div style="font-size: 1.25em;">
Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) is a well-known example of a multi-sided crowdsourcing platform that acts as a matchmaker, as described by Evans and Schmalensee (2017). It connects requesters, who post microtasks, “small, atomic tasks that workers can complete in their web browser”, with workers who complete them, while Amazon earns a commission on each transaction (AMT 2025).

# Infrastructural Inversion 

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 100px; align-items: center; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px;">

  <img src="/Users/olenonniboi/Desktop/p4.png" width="400" />
</div>

<div style="font-size: 1.25em;">
As part of the infrastructure inversion analysis, it was found that in January 2018, Amazon officially deprecated its legacy SOAP-based MTurk APIs and SDKs, warning that by June 1, 2019, those legacy endpoints would be disabled (AWS 2025). The documentation instructs requesters to “migrate to the latest version” (REST + AWS Signature v4) or risk losing functionality (ibid).  This shift made many requester systems rewrite code, reconfigure integrations, and realign with new naming conventions and authentication mechanisms.  
The deprecation notice itself is decisive because clients dependent on the old API were given a hard deadline, exposing how requesters already lived in a fragile dependency. This rupture reveals the hidden bridge. The APIs, which are typically invisible, became the site of forced adaptation. Requester tools, dashboards, and automation pipelines that had relied on SOAP now had to switch to REST. In doing so, the migration highlighted: (a) how requester systems are materially tied to Amazon’s infrastructure, (b) how Amazon holds authority to reshape that bridge, and (c) how fragile the requester platform relationship can be under infrastructural reconfigurations.

# Discussion 
<div style="font-size: 1.25em;">
Platforms such as AMT, as part of the larger Amazon ecosystem, can enforce their own rules on complementors whenever a regulatory issue arises.

Should the state interfere? If so, to what extent and in what way?
